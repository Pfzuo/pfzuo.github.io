I currently serve as the chief architect of AI-native storage at Huawei Cloud. I lead the EMS ([Elastic Memory Service](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/ems.html)) team to build a disaggregated memory service layer in the cloud, upgrading Huawei Cloud's two-tier infrastructure architecture that disaggregates storage and computing into a three-tier architecture that disaggregates computing, memory, and storage. This transformation enables higher resource elasticity and utilization. EMS also serves as a foundational memory infrastructure to enhance the efficiency of LLM training and inference on Huawei Cloud. 

I received my Ph.D. degree (advised by Prof. Yu Hua) in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2019. I was a visiting Ph.D. student (advised by Prof. Yuan Xie) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) during 2018-2019. I received a B.E. degree in Computer Science from HUST in 2014.  

My research interests span AI & cloud infrastructure, machine learning systems, storage systems, and distributed systems. I have published 50+ refereed papers in major conferences and journals in the field of computer systems and architectures, including SOSP, OSDI, MICRO, ASPLOS, FAST, USENIX ATC, VLDB, DAC, etc. I obtained the [2020 ACM China Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.acmturc.com/2021/cn/doctoral_thesis_award.html) (only two awardees among all computer disciplines across China every year) and the [Best Paper Award in FAST 2023](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/best-papers?taxonomy_vocabulary_1_tid=2023&title_1=FAST). The open-source codes for our research on AI systems and disaggregated data centers are available at [ASISys](https://github.com/ASISys) and [DMemSys](https://github.com/dmemsys), respectively.


***I am seeking motivated interns and postdocs in AI systems. If you're passionate about tackling key industry challenges and publishing impactful research, feel free to reach out!***
